                <p class="subtext editable">Brian has been a supporter and follower of the crypto asset ecosystem for 8 years and is a former miner of multiple cryptocurrencies to include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Zcash. Brian’s excitement for the Zcash ecosystem is rooted in his understanding of the importance of privacy in the digital economy. Intrigued by Zcash when he discovered the project in 2017, he participated in the Powers of Tau multi-party computation ceremony and has watched the project mature ever since. He is very excited to support the ecosystem as a Major Grant Review Committee member and is looking forward to approving high quality grants that bring growth and usability improvements in the coming years and further decentralize development within the Zcash ecosystem.</p>

                <p class="subtext editable">Jason McGee spent 15 years working in finance and accounting, most recently as the Head of Operations for a hedge fund in NYC.  He left his job in 2017 to focus on crypto full time and currently works as an independent trader and investor.  McGee first discovered Zcash in mid 2017, and more recently has become an active member in the Zcash community. In 2021, he led discussions on how to improve Zcash Community Grants' organizational structure, which ultimately resulted in an amendment to ZIP 1014 to provide the grants committee a discretionary budget.  McGee also serves as a moderator for the Zcash Community on Telegram.  He is excited to join Zcash Community Grants as a committee member and looks forward to funding projects that bring more users to Zcash and add more utility and value to ZEC.</p>
