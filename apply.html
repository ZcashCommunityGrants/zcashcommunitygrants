			<p class="editable">We aim to provide grants to teams of all sizes, from the individual hobbyist to specialist teams. Hobbyists and small teams have been the lifeblood of the Zcash ecosystem since its launch in 2016. Weâ€™d also like to reach out to large organizations who may not be actively looking to apply to grant programs, such as exchanges and widely adopted wallet providers. This will allow us to tap into their network of users and infrastructure, and ultimately accelerate our impact. We believe that this mix of small and large teams will allow us to spread more quickly and eEectively across the sea of potential ZEC users.</p>
