        <h3>Interested in applying for a Zcash Community Grant? Please take the time to review this entire page before submitting an application and note the following:</h3>
        <ul style="color:white">
            <li>If your grant is approved you will have to go through a Know Your Customer (KYC) process process and sign legal documentation with the Zcash Foundation prior to receiving any funds.</li>
            <li>The larger the requested sum, the more time we may require to evaluate your proposal, and funding will be divided into several milestone-based payouts.</li>
            <li>Applications can be submitted at any time, but they will be reviewed on a rolling basis, approximately once every two weeks.</li>
            <li>Here is a wishlist of things we want to fund. This list is nonexclusive, but your project should apply directly to Zcash or its ecosystem.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps to apply:</h3>
        <ol style="color:white">
            <li>First, create an account and submit your application on the Zcash Grants submittable platform <a href="https://zcashfoundation.submittable.com/submit">here</a>. Be sure to select the "<i>Zcash Community Grants Program</i>" at the bottom of the page. This is the most important step, so please make your application as complete as possible! We need to know what you are doing, why you are doing it, and your experience with this kind of project.</li>
            <li>After you submit your application, it will be put into a queue to await moderator approval. Once your application is approved by a grants platform moderator, you will receive an email notification with a public link to your application.</li>
            <li>When you receive the notification that your application is public, please post a link to it on the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/c/grants/applications/36">Zcash Community Forum</a> in the “applicants” category. This step is to gather community feedback about your project.</li>
            <li>Respond to our questions and to any community feedback in the forum thread. This part of the process is open to the general public, so be ready for some honest feedback, questions, and engagement with Zcash community members!</li>

        <h3 style="color:grey">What to expect:</h3>
        <ul style="color:grey">
            <li>Once you have posted your application to the grants platform and the forum, the Zcash Community Grants Committee will evaluate it, review community feedback on a rolling basis, and post a preliminary yes or no to continue with the application process, in your forum thread.</li>
            <li>If you receive a no, your application will be closed on the grants platform and an explanation will be posted on your forum thread.</li>
            <li>If you receive a yes to continue, the Committee may request improvements to your application and perform additional due diligence. For example, we may ask outside experts to weigh in on technical aspects of your project, or we may ask you for more information about your project, background, or experience. You may also be required to add milestones tied to incremental payouts to assure project follow through.</li>
            <li>The Zcash Community Grants Committee will vote during its bi-weekly meetings for a final approval or rejection of your grant. We strive to make this process as fast as possible while maintaining adequate due diligence. Our bi-weekly cadence means your application could be approved or rejected in just a few weeks.</li>
            <li>You will be notified on the forums and the grants platform that your grant has been approved or rejected.</li>
        </ul>
