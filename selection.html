                <ul style="color:white">
                    <li>Approved applicants will need to go through a KYC process to be eligible for funding, though they can remain pseudonymous to the public.</li>
                    <li>Applications can be submitted on a rolling basis, but will be reviewed every other week.</li>
                    <li>The larger the requested sum, the more diligence and milestones required</li>
                    <li>See our home page for a list of things we're ready to fund, but keep in mind this list is not all inclusive and we would love to hear your ideas!</li>
                    <li>Not sure if you're ready to submit an application? Have questions? Feel free to post your idea to the forums in the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/c/grants/33">Grants category</a> to solicit feedback. You can tag @ZcashGrants in your post to ask the Committee questions.</li>
