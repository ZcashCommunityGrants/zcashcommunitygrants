Dear Zcash Community,

After careful consideration, we are thrilled to announce that - as part of the ongoing evolution of the Major Grants program - we will be rebranding the Zcash Open Major Grants, changing its name to Zcash Community Grants.

How did we get here?

Our new identity encompasses all the existing expectations of what the Zcash Open Major Grants originally stood for, while simultaneously moving the brand forward to acknowledge the important role that the Zcash community plays in this ecosystem. It is the Zcash community that elected to allocate the largest slice of the dev fund for major grants to fund community-led development activities that benefit the Zcash ecosystem.

With Zcash and the Zcash community in mind, our goal was to pick a name that is simple, timeless, and consistent with other programs in the industry, one that would facilitate search engine optimization (SEO). This is how we arrived at “Zcash Community Grants”.

As of this moment, our Twitter handle has changed to @ZcashCommGrants 10 and you can find us on the web at [zcashcommunitygrants.org](https://zcashcommunitygrants.org)

We are now a few weeks into our role as Zcash community-elected major grants committee members. We’ve been engaged in a flurry of activity with the Zcash Foundation ranging from understanding current policies and ZF resources made available to the committee, approving the largest grant in Major Grants history to bring shielded assets to Zcash 3, and discussing exciting things to come such as a Zcash Ambassador Program, multiple RFPs and grant ideas, and upcoming milestone deliverables for currently active grants. One of our additional tasks in the upcoming weeks will be to update all our online branding to better reflect the changes described above.

As you notice changes in our branding, signs and promotions feel free to reach out with any thoughts, requests or comments. We’re excited to be part of the next chapter in Zcash’s history and look forward to a productive year funding projects to build out the Zcash ecosystem.

Sincerely,

Zcash Community Grants Committee
