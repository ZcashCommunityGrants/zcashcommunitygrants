The Zcash Community Grants Committee is proud to announce the launch of the new website. Check it out at [https://zcashcommunitygrants.org](https://zcashcommunitygrants.org)

The site theme embodies an orange color that is associated with sunshine, enthusiasm, success, encouragement, change, determination & freedom.

We’ve streamlined the contents section to highlight what we fund and the Grants Process, including a Contact Us form for prospective applicants to reach out to the grants committee(via ZF) to resolve any outstanding questions. There is a direct link to the Zcash Community Grants Dashboard to view the total funds on hand and the progress of various proposals in flight.

We thank the Zcash Foundation to supply us with the content they had started to put together towards a micro-site for ZCG within the ZF main-site. The ZCG decided to own the landing site to have direct control to share news or make changes. @wobbzz, @BrunchTime & @aiyadt worked together to get the site up & running within a couple of weeks. We’ve spent ~$20 from the discretionary budget to obtain the domains including [zcashcommunitygrants.com](zcashcommunitygrants.com) which redirects to the org TLD. The site is hosted via GitHub pages.

We will continue to work towards making contributions to Zcash approachable to every prospective grant applicant. Look forward to our upcoming forum posts about requests for inputs around grant ideas we are looking to fund this year.

Please use [this thread](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/zcg-website-announcement/41083) to share any feedback you have on the website.

Sincerely,

The Zcash Community Grants Committee
